## Overall Learning 

In this project, I gained hands-on tech skills by implementing admin-level features like issue verification, assignment, and status updates, while diving into authentication and authorization to secure operations and using filters with dashboards to manage huge volumes of reported civic issues efficiently. On the management front, I documented workflows clearly for smooth team integration, collaborated via version control and shared APIs, and truly appreciated how role-based access keeps platforms secure and collaborative without chaos

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
LST (Life Skills Training) and SST workshops delivered targeted training on key personal, career, and office competencies. In LST, I developed skills in professional dialogue, appreciating gratitude, robust work principles, emotional awareness, and attentive listening, gaining insights into office conduct, online professionalism and manners, bargaining techniques, leading teams, persuading others, and delivering compelling presentations. They also steered me toward advancing my career, establishing clear objectives, and fostering a success-oriented outlook.
SST honed my tech efficiency with AI, where I grasped core prompt engineering principles, mastered crafting high-impact prompts to streamline work tasks, and experimented with AI for innovative solutions. The workshops stressed scrutinizing AI-generated results and smart strategies for embedding AI ethically into routine processes.
